<h1> tools that i am using: </h1>
- [HexManiacAdvance](https://github.com/haven1433/HexManiacAdvance)<br>
- [mGBA - GBA emulator](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba)

<h2> Known issues with HMA: </h2>
Speaking with the developer at the moment only "BPEE" is supported (pokemon emerald english version).

But we can [edit](https://github.com/haven1433/HexManiacAdvance/wiki/TOML-and-You:-How-Metadata-works) the .toml file that is created (named "gbaromname.toml") when the tool is started.<br>
For the correct addresses we can refer to [this](https://github.com/Gamer2020/PokemonGameEditor/blob/master/roms.ini).

<h3> Other tools: </h3>
- [PGE](https://github.com/Gamer2020/PokemonGameEditor): this editor supports BPEI.<br>
- [Advanced Map Editor](http://getam.no-ip.info/?ver=1.95): to be tested.<br>
